How does a term plan work?
A term plan is the most elementary form of life insurance. By purchasing a term insurance
policy, you, as the ‘policyholder pay a nominal amount as ‘premium’ for a certain period or
tenure. The earlier you purchase a term plan, the lesser will be the premium (per year) you have
to pay. In case, you meet an unfortunate incident resulting in loss of your life, your family or
‘nominee’ is given the ‘sum assured’ or ‘cover’ - large lump sum amount to meet your financial
liabilities. In case you wish to have a additional coverage beyond just life cover, you can choose
riders, such as critical illness and disability.
Does term insurance come under 80c?
Like all life insurance products, term insurance also offers tax benefits. Primarily, you get tax
rebates for the premiums paid under your policy. Premium paid for a term plan will offer tax
benefits under sec 80C of the Income Tax Act. Any payout made to the beneficiaries is tax free.
What are the exclusions while buying term insurance?
Death cover under all circumstances except the following:
Death due to any pre-existing medical condition not mentioned in the policy term
Death due to any illegal activity
Suicide within the first year of policy tenure
What does term insurance mean?
Term life insurance is the simplest form of life insurance that protects your family and
dependents against financial crisis even when you are not around. Term insurance plans offer
high assured sums at low-cost premiums. The sum assured is paid to the nominee in case of
the demise of the person insured during the tenure of the term insurance policy.
How much should a term plan cover?
The coverage or sum assured of term life insurance depends on various factors. These factors
include: ● The number of dependents you have ● The kind of lifestyle you will want to provide to
your loved ones in case of your untimely demise ● Your savings, expenses, as well as
investment needs ● Term insurance premium you can afford to pay ● The amount needed for
your children’s education, your family’s needs, medical and emergency expenses, as well as
increasing inflation rate However, you can use a term insurance calculator to calculate the term
policy coverage as well as the premium amount you will have to pay for certain tenure. We
recommend you ensure term policy coverage 15-20 times your annual income to accumulate
enough coverage. If you start early, you will have to pay low premiums for the same amount of
coverage.
What is the best term plan?
The best term insurance is one that offers the best ‘value for money.’ Choosing the best term
insurance in India is essential to provide financial security to your family even when you are not
around. The term insurance premium of your term plan, however, depends on three basic things
- your age, term period, as well as the assured sum you choose.
Can I have two Term Insurance Policies?
Yes, you can buy as many term insurance plans as you need or want to invest in. You can buy
all the term plans online either from one insurer or multiple insurers. With age, expenses, as well
as responsibilities, grow. Thus, it makes sense if you are thinking of buying multiple term life
insurance plans. While buying multiple term insurance policies, you have to consider two
important points: ● Disclose all your existing policies to your insurer while buying the new one. ●
Read all the term insurance related documents carefully and understand all the features,
benefits, inclusions as well as exclusions.
What is the age limit to buy term insurance?
The age limit to buy term insurance varies based on the plan you choose. However, you can
buy term life insurance online or offline if you are at least 18 years old.

determined by factors such as the policyholder’s entry age, the annualized premium, and the
policy term chosen. Since the premium payment term (PPT) is 5 years less than the policy term
(PT), it allows policyholders to stop paying premiums while still enjoying coverage until the
policy matures.
Option B
In Option B, the Death Sum Assured is equal to the Maturity Sum Assured. The premium
payable under this option is calculated considering the policyholder’s entry age, sum assured,
and the policy term chosen. Similar to Option A, the premium payment term is 5 years less than
the policy term.
